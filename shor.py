Name: Adam Klein

This program is an implementation of Shor's algorithm that finds the factors of 15
using Qiskit quantum programming software.

Shor's algorithm turns the problem of factor finding into a problem of period finding.
Given the periodic function f(x) = ax mod N for some a, if we know the period of the function,
then we can find the factors of N with relative ease.

To calculate the period r of the function, the algorithm defines a gate which has
an eigenvalue of s/r for some random s. The eigenstate is |1>.

Quantum Phase Estimation can be used to find this s/r, and continued fractions or similar methods
can then be used to calculate r. Once r is known, Euclid's algorithm can be used to convert it
into the factors of N.

The proccess of finding the factors includes choosing some random a, running shor's algorithm
on it, and repeating until a suitable pair of factors is found.

This is explained in more detail on my slide presentation.

Note: This program was intended for use within Jupyter Notebook for a demonstration, so much of the style and 
functionality is lost in this format.

"""
Define gates for periodic function U|y> = |ay mod 15>

To model the periodic function, we need gates that can do the function's operation.
These functions create circuits for 4-qubit systems that take in the system's state,
|y>, and converts it into |a*y mod 15>. Gates only need to be defined for when a doesn't share
a common factor with 15.

Note: These functions return circuits, which can be converted into gates.
