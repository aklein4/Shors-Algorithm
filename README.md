# Shors-Algorithm
An implementation of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm on the number 15.

Final project for PHYSICS14N: Quantum Information: Visions and Emerging Technologies at Stanford University.

Uses IBM's qiskit python API for quantum circuit contruction and simulation.
qiskit can be found here: https://qiskit.org/

My project includes a successful python program which implements and demonstrates Shor's algorithm,
by finding the factors of 15 (3 and 5) using the properties of quantum superposition and phase estimation.

Included are a .py file containing the raw code, a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) which contains both the code and the output,
and a slide deck which contains an explaination of the algorithm, its implentation, and the underlying math.
